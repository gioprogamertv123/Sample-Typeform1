        <h2 class="bold">HTML </h2>
        <p class="whatisanswer">
            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard <br>
            language used to structure and format content on the web.  <br>
            Itdefines the structure of web pages using elements such <br>
            as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and tables. <br>
            HTML elements are written as tags, which are <br>
            enclosed in angle brackets. Browsers interpret HTML <br>
            to render the visual and interactive aspects of a <br>
            webpage. HTML works alongside CSS and JavaScript <br>
            to create dynamic and visually appealing websites. <br>

            HTML (HyperText Markup Language) was first <br>
            developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a <br>
            simple way to structure documents on the <br>
            World Wide Web. It is a declarative <br>
            language, meaning it tells the browser <br>
            what to display but not how to display it. <br>
            HTML uses a tree-like structure, starting with <br>
            a root html element, followed by child <br>
            elements like head and body. The head <br>
            section includes metadata such as the title, <br>
            character encoding, and links to external <br>
            stylesheets or scripts, while the body <br>
            section contains the main content of the <br>
            webpage, including text, images, and other <br>
            media. Attributes provide additional <br>
            information about HTML elements, such as <br>
            the href attribute in a tags for links, <br>
            and forms enable user input through elements <br>
            like input, textarea, and button. HTML <br>
            documents are constantly evolving, with new <br>
            versions adding functionality to support <br>
            the changing needs of the web. <br>

        <p class="answer123">
            CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a language <br>
            used to style and format the appearance of <br>
            HTML elements on a webpage. It allows <br>
            developers to control layout, colors, <br>
            fonts, spacing, and other design <br>
            aspects to create visually appealing<br>
             websites. CSS works by applying rules <br>
             through selectors and properties, <br>
             which can be embedded in HTML, included <br>
             in a style tag, or linked as an external <br>
             stylesheet. It supports responsive design <br>
             through media queries, enabling webpages <br>
             to adapt to different screen sizes and <br>
             devices. By separating content (HTML) <br>
             from design (CSS), it improves <br>
             maintainability and reusability of code. <br>
             CSS also supports advanced features like <br>
             animations and transitions, adding <br>
             interactivity and enhancing user experience.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="answer555">
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to <br>
            create functional and visually appealing <br>
            websites. HTML provides the structure of <br>
            the webpage, defining elements like headings, <br>
            paragraphs, images, and forms. CSS styles <br>
            these elements, controlling their layout, <br>
            colors, fonts, and responsiveness to make <br>
            the design attractive and user-friendly. <br>
            
            JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic <br>
            behavior, enabling features like form <br>
            validation, interactive menus, and <br>
            real-time content updates. For example, <br>
            a website might use HTML to display a <br>
            button, CSS to style it with colors and <br>
            hover effects, and JavaScript to trigger <br>
            an action when itâ€™s clicked. Together, <br>
            these technologies create seamless and <br>
            engaging web experiences. <br>

        <h1 class="blabla">Examples of Websites coded in HTML, CSS <br>and JavaScript </h1>
        <p class="yestheycan">
            Many modern websites effectively combine <br>
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver <br>
            engaging user experiences. For instance, <br>
            e-commerce platforms like Amazon use <br>
            HTML for product structure, CSS for <br>
            styling the layout, and JavaScript <br>
            for features like search suggestions <br>
            and dynamic shopping carts. Social <br>
            media sites like Facebook and Twitter <br>
            rely on this combination to display <br>
            posts (HTML), style profiles and <br>
            timelines (CSS), and enable live <br>
            notifications and interactive features <br>
            (JavaScript). News websites like BBC or <br>
            CNN use HTML to organize articles, CSS <br>
            for responsive layouts, and JavaScript <br>
            for interactive slideshows and live <br>
            updates. technologies for user-friendly <br>
            designs, animations, and dynamic content <br>
            loading. These examples demonstrate how HTML, <br>
            CSS, and JavaScript work together to <br>
            build versatile, functional websites. <br>
